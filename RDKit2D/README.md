Code for all 22 ADMET data sets (https://tdcommons.ai/benchmark/admet_group/overview/) using RDKit2D molecular descriptors (https://www.blopig.com/blog/2022/06/how-to-turn-a-molecule-into-a-vector-of-physicochemical-descriptors-using-rdkit/) is provided here. The notebook 'CFA + RDKit.ipynb' is for the generation of predictions, and the notebook 'model_fusion' is for the generation of model fusion results using the prediction results from single base models.

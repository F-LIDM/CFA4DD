Code and data (csv files) for all 22 ADMET data sets (https://tdcommons.ai/benchmark/admet_group/overview/) using MCFP, a proprietary fingerprints, is provided here. Users would need to generate the prediction results of single base models using the codebook file 'CFA + MCFP_1.ipynb', and then get the model fusion results using 'model_fusion'. Depending the task/tasks that one wants to perform (see https://tdcommons.ai/benchmark/admet_group/overview/ for full list of task names), the task name/names need to be changes in both notebook files and make them work.
